-<Introduction>-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello, I'm Jamie Caie and this is my guide about the locations of all
Gold Coins (that you can collect?) in "Super Mario Sunshine".

However so far it only includes those areas/etc reachable by the end of
Super Mario Sunshine. (I.e. No bosses in Delfino Plaza!)
I'm also expecting people using this to be fairly familiar with the game,
i.e. completed (or got far with) any episode they look up.

Being able to collect all the Gold coins in the game isn't really all
that important, but can come in useful for various reasons.
The main ones I can think of are: for Healing purposes, collecting 100
Coins Shine Sprites and for getting High Scores. (See below:-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
>Healing Purposes: Being new to the game, many people find themselves
taking damage often, since Coins can heal this damage it's often handy
to know roughly where to look when low on health.

Plus; for every 50 coins you gain a 1-Up increasing your survival(?)
on the Island!

>100 Coins Shine Sprites: Reaching 100 Gold Coins in any area, will create
another Shine for you to collect (1 per Land). Since each episode has a
different number of coins, it is handy to know which you want to try for.

Note: I purposely haven't suggested which Episode you should try. I have
left it up to your own judgement as to which sets of coins you are able
to collect, (since people find different parts to be hard or easy,) but
I have noted the harder ones to fully collect.

>High Scores: Pretty obvious, to get the best high score you need to
collect the most coins, therefore need to know when and where to collect
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, to help you with collecting these coins I've made a list of all
the locations for each group of Coins, for each Episode in each Land.

I'm sorry for the length of this guide. For better usage, I suggest you
find the Episode(/etc) that you want and (copy &) Print out that JUST
that area.
Then you can use the print-out as a checklist in front of your Gamecube.

#=====================================================================
-<Coin Locations>-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here it is, the list of all known coin locations, (bar the Coins that
definitely need a Yoshi when there isn't one available!)

Each Land has a short description, then each Episode's Coin locations,
with its Total (collectable coins) underneath.

The format is: Difficulty*. Location.... Number of Coins. (Out of how many
coins you can see, but can't collect all of). -<Note in Gold Hard Cash@>-

About difficulty; a * symbol means that it is more tricky, time consuming
or randomly (im-)possible to collect all the coins mentioned.
If you're a novice, (collecting for the 100 Coins Shine Sprite,) you should
expect to get less than the full amount for these coins in a quick attempt.
I.e: only 2 coins out of the possible 4.

Two asterisks, ** means collecting all the coins are even more annoying,
you'll have to practice getting these coins, if you want them all.
Three asterisks, *** well, you might have to repeat the episode over and
over again, or spend hours, if you want to total this high score.

Number of coins = " N.o. * ? ", when the total of coins available is
randomly amount, (with no general limit,) then I've put a ? to show this.
Most of these can be infinite, (if you go on that long,) otherwise I've
put a note in "Gold Hard Cash" as to when it should runs out.

Note: I'm not all seeing / all knowing. I might have missed a few coins
here and there. New locations may be discovered yet!

#=====================================================================
-<Bianco Hills>-

The path leads to a the river. Over the river is the Town, two Houses
great you, one with an Balcony with 2 Arches. Behind these are two huts
with sails atop. Lastly a Mansion with two short, hollow towers.
Besides the town's wall a path leads under the Bells (& mini-Waterwheel)
to the Big Waterwheel. Behind the Town is a mountain to climb.
On the opposite side of the Wall is the Lake area, with a Grove of
Trees, a Bridge leading to the Big Windmill and Brick Ledges, (South of

source of the river.)

South-West of the Shine Gate is the Crate Game House, west of that is the
Juice goop Tower. (S.E. of the Pinna Park Cannon.)
The Cliff west of the Cannon is the Palm Tree Cliff. South of this is
the Coconut Lady's Island.

-<Gold Hard Cash>-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are notes which come with the Coin Locations, that are too long to
be written in that section.
Most are help, telling you how to get some of the harder coins. Others
are clarifications and general notes.
=====================================================================
-<Bianco Hills>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<A@>-
Get these coins First. Collecting enemy's/hidden/flowers'/etc coins can
lessen the amount you receive for some reason. Also they can sometimes
fall through the wall.

To reveal them either spin the Water-wheel with the Squirt nozzle, press R
until it clicks. Or jump over and use the Hover Nozzle to spin it.

Note: Watch out for when the coins land atop the Wall, or the Bell's support,
walljump & hover to get on the wall to collect them.

-<B@>-
Get these Second, (after <A@>) because the Skeeters tend to "suicide" if you
leave them be for a long enough time.

Try to stop (/slow) the leaf before eating them, the coin appears right next
to you. Plus jumping off Yoshi makes the leaf bob him into the drink.

-<C@>-
An easier way to get these coins is to: stand on top of the Mini-windmill,
hang off the edge with the sails, (Don't Shinny!) and use your Hover Nozzle
to spin the sails.

Some of the mills are harder to get onto, you may need to Triple jump/hover
from the Mountains, etc, etc...
The one atop the house may need a Rocket Nozzle to collect, on some Episodes.

-<D@>-
See <C@> for general tips. If there's no wire to the Tall Mini-windmill by the
Grove then you might be able to use a Skeeter to gain enough height.

To get onto the wires around the windmill with the Hover Nozzle, bounce on
the Bridge's wires to hover onto the Rows of wires, (if there).
Or jump/hover from the Big Windmill's sails to reach the closer ones.

-<E@>-
This one can be especially hard because the coins are almost impossible to
collect if any fall off the platform. Added to this annoyance is that it
can takes so long to get back here, after you collect the other "Must collect
first" coins, when you restart the level.

-<F@>-
The first is on the wire from the Cave to the Grove, Stand Yoshi on the
nearby Mini-windmill, Hover over to the wire and lure him back the same way.

The other two are high over the lake. Take Yoshi to the Big Windmill, ride
the sails and jump over to the nearest Mini-windmill. Jump the gap to the
other mini-windmill and Lure the Gusty back to Yoshi here.
Then do the same things again, accept on the other side of the Windmill.

-<G@>-
Since it's hard to see where you want to spread the goop, here are the areas
where the 4 piranha plants will appear:-
>In front of the First Sail hut's door (right side of the door).
>Left a bit of the Second Sail hut's Front.
>Right of the 2nd Sail hut's mid-Corner/ Down gap in front of Mansion's door.
>In the field right of the Mansion roughly. It's a big field so:-

-At the end of the dirt Path are two Dots (as it fades off). Stand on the
Left Edge of the Path (facing the Mansion's end) and walk in a straight
line along the Left Edges of the two Dots, past the Mansion's corner and
the Goop. Just beyond this goop is the spot. (Roughly)

Spread goop by sliding out of it, or getting the Goop-Bubbles to jump at
you. (Dodge out the way as soon as they jump.)

=====================================================================
-<Ricco Harbor>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<H@>-
To get on top of the Tower use the two Construction supports on the west
side, they're close together enough to Walljump up, on top of them.

To get the 2 coins you need to use your Highest Spin jump from the peak
of the Tower and Hover. (Maybe ending with a Ground Pound.)
Or if you find that too hard try take a Barrel up there to stand on. You
won't need to spin jump quite as high to get them.

Note: when you put down the Barrel, its platform will be off centre. It'll
be floating invisibly where Mario was standing and not the top of the Barrel.
(Also remember Ground Pounding will break the Barrel).

-<I@>-
To collect these coins you'll have to jump/hover from nearby high platforms,
such as the end of the Construction Works or the Towering Platforms.
(Use the ledges in the cliff to hover over to Towering Platforms.)

You may need to Dive after hovering to reach the further away coins.

-<J@>-
Most of the Gustys are on the Construction Works, but there are also two
on the Construction Planks around the Tower.
You may have to dive into the water to collect some coins (losing Yoshi).

=====================================================================
-<Gelato Beach>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<K@>-
Walk under the Sand Cabana until you're standing roughly under the Till,
when you jump up coins will spring out in a circle around it.
(If 8 didn't appear; try hitting a different part under it for the rest).

-<L@>-
To get onto the High Wire use a Rocket Nozzle from the lower Twin Wire to
the higher one. Then cross/bounce over to it.
Or bounce from the wire at right angles to the Twin Wires, over the Cleft,
to gain height to Hover over to the Higher Twin. Etc...

Stand in the middle of the High wire and drop (facing the coins), Super
Whirl Jump whilst holding forwards and you'll get most, if not all the
coins, repeat until you gain them all.

-<M@>-
To get these the Red Cataquacks out of your way, get one to follow you to
the edge of a cliff, and Walk & Hover off the edge. (Don't Jump off!)
The Cataquack will follow, forgetting its inability fly and plummet, like
it's in a Cartoon :)

Once down here it's stuck trying to get back up. But you can get it to chase
you to a Dune Bud, by walking too close, if you want to destroy them.
(Note: Don't get their coins whilst stuck down there, it'll go through the
cliff face into oblivion.)

-<N@>-
You can move the Watermelons by pushing them along, or squirting them with
Fludd:
>Pushing will move them quickly, but they can often go randomly off course
if hit at the wrong angle.
>Squirting will go slowly, but Always goes forward in the direction you're
facing no matter where you hit it.

Personally I use both at the same time, if the Watermelon goes off, the
Squirt Nozzle catches it back on course.
Once on the Pier bit, watch the Watermelon's Shadow to see where it's going,
the Squirt Nozzle is more useful here.

Lastly watch out for the 10 coins appear randomly and disappear quite quick.
Try get the ones on the land before the sea.

-<O@>-
Have Fludd on Hover Nozzle when you hit the switch, the coins appear in a
Teardrop shape on the Hillside.

Ideally you want to: slide down through the middle, jump & hover and turn
quickly round so you're facing/hovering up the Hill. Drop and run up through
this side of the Tear, curve round and slide down through the other side.

This is even harder than it sounds since you're up against the time.
Admittedly the most I've ever gotten was 17, I slid through the middle, up
the left and slid a little too far on the right, missing the last 3.
If you can get 12 or more then you're doing very well!

=====================================================================
-<Pinna Park>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<P@>-
The Sand with the Hidden coins covers all the sand between the Beach Cannon
to the Path (leading to the Park's Entrance).

Although they appear in exactly the same spots every time, it's impossible
to describe every location (on a blank Beach!).
So unfortunately you may have to search every spot over and over just to
find that last coin :(

-<Q@>-
Since Wading through the water is a little slow, you might want to jump
between the coin gaps/etc, so you don't run out of time.

=====================================================================
-<Sirena Beach>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<R@>-
This includes the two Big Circular Fountains and the pavement around them,
the thin grass verge in front of the Sun-beds and the stairs up to the
Hotel Platform.

-<S@>-
For the two up on the Hotel's ledge, try hovering over there from the top
of the Drinks Hut first.

-<T@>-
May need to splutter to get the coin. The tiles you want, are located:-
>First Floor over the 2nd, 4th and 6th doors, clockwise from the stairs.
>Second Floor above the 1st and 4th doors, clockwise from the stairs.

-<U@>-
To enter this room either: Goto the last cubicle in the Ladies' Room, stand
over the toilet and jump up.
Or goto the Blank Picture room and Ground Pound the Glass Table. (However
you'll need to go through the attic to get into that room.)

-<V@>-
To enter this room either: Goto the last cubicle in the Men's Room, stand
over the toilet and jump up.
Or goto the Pool Room and Ground Pound one of the two flip tiles. (Squirt
the floor in order to find them.)

Although it is also possible to also get in from the Closet Room, through
the Mirror/Boo-Painting.

-<W@>-
You can keep spinning the Jumbo slots (on the right) until you get triple 7s,
but unless you're really very impossibly lucky, you're not going to roll
enough coins to gain 100 from this, let alone 999 coins.

-<X@>-
Stopping the Wheels by Ground Pounding the Purple tiles will make it much
easier to defeat enemies/collect coins.
You want to roll three question marks, ? ? ? to get a random selection of
enemies. You don't have long, so try deal with them quickly for the coins.

The other Slots to look out for is three coins, you only get them when you
start getting hurt. But rolling this will get you 10 coins.
A possible tactic is to damage yourself on purpose and hope you don't roll
? ? ? instead.

Also, when you roll Fruit, pick up a Chilli and run underneath King Boo to
the other side. He should pop down (Mind your head!) straight after, saving
you a little more game time.

=====================================================================
-<Noki Bay>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<Y@>-
To get up here, use the Rocket Nozzle from the Waterfall's Stepped Ledges.
Or use a Spring to walljump high enough to hover. (From the same place).

-<Z@>-
Cross the Shinning Ledges from the First Scale's Wheel in the West Cliff.
After rounding the corner onto the South cliff face, in the middle is
the square gap and two Wall Paintings.

In the Square gap Spray some water, or stand in the middle & use the Hover
Nozzle to make the coin appear.

-<1@>-
The Easiest points to spray these from are:-
>Purple Shell Tower, on the Step next to the Cliff ledge can get the 3 holes
closest above the Mudboat Rental, Sometimes 1 round the corner too.
>The Sticking-out Part of the Waterfall's Stepped Ledges, can get the 6
round the corner. (Though the Waterfall impedes vision slightly.)

Although there are other ways, (Top of cliff, Rocket nozzle & Ground Pound).

When you spray the right spot the coins will fall onto the ground/water
surface below, they stay there a while. But if you don't want to be sucked
under the water by the waterfall, you'll need to use a Mudboat for some.
This wastes a lot of time so try only doing 2 at most, if you're not very
good at using them.

-<2@>-
Jump and Hover to get into one, Walk, Hover out and round to enter rest.
Or use the Rocket Nozzle from Ledge below them.

-<3@>-
Get on the Ledge where the Rocket Nozzle normally is. If there's no Spring
you'll have to hover over from the Brick ledges at the Top of the West
side of the Cliff.

Without the Rocket Nozzle you can only get 5 of the 9 coins. What you need
to do is stand in the little Hole over the Arch. Spin jump out of the Hole
and Hover, a Ground Pound will also help gain a little more height.

It will take quite a while to manage a Spinjump from that Hole. All I can
suggest is to just keep trying. (Make sure you've practiced Ground Pounding
from a Hover, or you'll kick yourself!)

-<4@>-
The coins fall onto the surface of the sea, dive off the ledge and quickly
swim round collecting them.
You'll often find that you run out of time before the last couple.

=====================================================================
-<Pianta Village>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<5@>-
Since you Don't have Yoshi you have little chance to get them, Ground Pound
the Scuttle Bug so they land on a Tree's Branch or a Swing. You'll have
to jump off and hover over there very quickly to catch the coin.

So far I only managed to collect 1 this way, (Bug near Mayor's House Exit)
I jumped on the mushroom, Hovered up the tree, got the coin, but ran out &
fell off to my death. (Counted to my highscore, but I couldn't repeat.)

-<6@>-
Now you have Yoshi available, I suggest you bring an Orange one. Take him
to the Underside (I normally Jump off from the Long Grass as a shortcut,
Land on the Black & Yellow Mushroom beneath.)

You can Spin Jump Yoshi to get on top of the Metal screens, once up there
he can also jump across small gaps (before he hits his head!).

When you've gotten Yoshi in sight of a Scuttle Bug I suggest you Spray them,
turning them into a Orange Platform. You'll have to wait a bit before the
Platform pops, so try do several and come back. Leave Yoshi for far ones.
(Note: the coins tend to jump Southwards to land on the Metal screens.)

You could also Eat them to save time, but I find the coins appear under
the screens and drop into oblivion.
Either way you'll have to make several journeys with Yoshi to get all 10.

-<7@>-
Just to Clarify, The Single Black & Yellow Mushroom is not the B & Y
Mushroom paired with a Green Mushroom. But the one next to a Black & Green
Mushroom, (in the Underside bit of course).

-<8@>-
Remember the Chucksters throw you the direction you're facing, when you are
talking to them. (Not the direction you faced before pressing B.)
If you can, Squirt the walking ones with water to stop them (to aim).

-<9@>-
After you save an Adult Pianta  they will give you a Blue coin (/1up) when
you talk to them. If the ground they stand on gets cover with goop, they
sink back in and you can rescue them again. This time for a Gold coin.

Since the goop damages you, what you need to do is get the Goop-Bubbles to
Jump at you, & Dodge out the way so it lands by the Pianta. Or bounce off
them when they're walking through the Pianta.

The Goop-Bubbles travel towards the centre of the Level, use this to your
advantage to make the Goop-Bubbles come to you. (So the Piantas are
in-between the goop puddles and the centre).

=====================================================================
-<Delfino Plaza>-
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-<10@>-
The Tops of the Towers are a little small so mostly the coin falls off.
Catch it before it falls, or jump after it quickly.

-<11@>-
In case you haven't found this sewer, goto the Parasols on the Beach and
search just North-East of the North Parasol. To search, walk over the sand
and watch out for a Bobbing black circle that appears when you walk over it.

You can also see the entrance from inside the nearby sewer passages.

-<Enemy List>-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"A Rose by any other name, would still smell as sweet."

Since the game doesn't list all the names of the enemies, and because I
have yet to see a proper list of (official?) names:-
I have given various names to every enemy mentioned in this guide. In
order for you to tell which one I'm talking about, here is a list of the
enemies, a description of them, and how to get their coins /etc.

Note: this is NOT a list of every enemy in the game, and neither have I
used the official name for most of them.
=====================================================================
-<Bees>---------------------

Use Yoshi to eat the bees, the last bee doesn't have a Gold coin.
Remember to break the Hive to get the whole Swarm.

-<Big Burt Bug>---------------------

A Bigger version of the Burt Bug, can steal Mario's hat. Drops 5 coins.

-<Blooper>---------------------

A white Octopus that spits ink at you. Found in lots of Mario games.
Squirting it will stun it. (Beware, that can knock into the water for no
coin!) Drops one coin when killed.
Note: If on a girder, you may have to jump off after the coin.

-<Blue Spitting Flower>---------------------

A blue plant (with pink petals,) that dives under the ground & spits out
harmful droplets, whenever Mario get close.
To kill stun it with water from a distance, then go over and jump/etc on
it. Only has one Coin each.

-<Bob-bomb>---------------------

A Tropical version of the walking Bomb. Stun it with water, then throw it
to release the coin. (Landing back from where you threw.)

-<Boo>---------------------

These ghosts aren't as Shy as the usual sort, tending to turn invisible
every now and again instead. (Use water to make visible again.)
They also like to disguise themselves as coins and other things, get too
close and they spring to life. The Fakes don't spin/etc.

For either, just jump on them to kill, reward of one coin.

-<Bullet Bill>---------------------

These bombard the area, but Spraying them, or jumping on them will destroy
it, releasing 2 gold coins each. The Golden Bills are the same but drop
8 coins in a circle when killed.
Homing Bills (Purple with a flashing nose) are killed the same way, but
can follow Mario around in circles making them more dangerous.

-<Burt>---------------------

In Yoshi's Island there was a Boss called Burt the Bashful (and the
smaller types just called Burts). He was orange, round with two round
feet, a long round nose, black eyes and an awful taste in trousers.
O.k. these enemies are shorter and probably not called Burt, but the
resemblance is enough for me to use it.

Simple to kill, (jump on them,) try turning 3 or more upside-down and
jumping on one for a 1-up Mushroom.

-<Burt Bug>---------------------

A small flying version of Burt, use water to lower their height and
jump on them for your coin.

-<Burt on Fire>---------------------

A Red Burt with a Flame on his head. Dowse the flame and he'll turn
Gray, (for a while,) then deal with him like a normal Burt.

-<Butterflies>---------------------

Not really an enemy, just eat the last yellow Butterfly in a Group to
get a coin. (With Yoshi of course!)

-<Cataquack>---------------------

Blue Circular birds that flip you into the air. Turn upside down and
jump on them for a coin. (Via Sprayed or walked into something.)

If you want to Kill them though, get them to chase you and run over to
a Dune Bud. They'll walk into it and get stunned. Spray the Dune Bud,
(use Hover nozzle for speed growth) and it'll throw them high in the
air, killing them when they land.
You could also get the coin this way, but it'll probably land amongst
active Cataquacks.

Also come in a Red colour, the difference being a point of damage when
they throw you. Treat the same.

-<Cheep-cheep>---------------------

Two types, neither with coins though, so just avoid.
Orange & Blue Fish that jump out of the water.
Pink & Purple Fish that drag Mario down under water.

-<Chuckster>---------------------

Sounds like an enemy, but is a Pianta who can throw you distances.

-<Electro-Koopa>---------------------

A Koopa with an electric shell. To get all 4 coins, you need to wet
them, whilst they've thrown their shell at you. When the shell returns
it shocks them instead.

I prefer to jump over and use the Hover Nozzle to spray them. Thus
avoiding the shell myself!

-<Fake-Coin Boo>---------------------
See:- Boo.

-<Fake-Shadow-Mario Boo>---------------------
See:- Boo.

-<Golden Bill>---------------------
See:- Bullet Bill.

-<Goop-Bubble>---------------------

The bubble monsters that appear from the goop, they walk for a bit
then explode Goop. Or they see Mario, Jump at him, and Goop where
they land.

Useful for spreading goop, (just dodge out their way after the jump,)
but don't give coins. Although can give water-bottles if jumped on.

-<Green Bird>-------+--------------

Not exactly an enemy, just a bird you can spray to get a coin.
After Flying around they always return to the same roost. (Listed in
the coin location's description.) So you could wait nearby and spray
them when they come back to land.

-<Gusty>--=-------------------

Another name from Yoshi's Island. They're gusts of wind with a face,
that only Yoshi can eat (to kill & get a coin).
So I'm thinking, "What's Gusty Taste Like?"

-<Homing Bill>----------------+-----
See:- Bullet Bill.

-<Hopping Flower>---=------------------

An orange bodied plant with pink petals, that springs out the ground
when you get close and hops around following Mario.
To get all three coins, you need to spray the Hopping flower into a
wall, squashing it. (The coins appear around the body.)

-<Jellyfish>---------------------

Jellyfish that jump out of the Water in Ricco Harbor. Can't be killed,
but can be used as a platform after being hit.

-<Pidgit Bomber>---------------------=

A Mario-esque name. These birds look like orange hens, (except hens don't
fly,) and act like pigeons. When Mario gets close they try to drop Muck
on his head!

Spray the Pidgit Bomber with water and it'll drop some coins, after a
total of ten gold coins, it'll drop a 1-up Mushroom, then nothing else.
To get the last(/11th) coin you have to kill it. Spray with water to
lower it's height, until it crashes into the ground. Or you could jump
on it...etc.

-<Piranha Plant>--+-------------------

Plants that grow out of the goop, (they need the goop or won't appear,)
when Mario gets close to that spot. They then fire goop-missiles at Mario

If you jump on them they dive under the ground for a bit, (remember they
need goop to resurface...) If you want to kill them spray them full of
water until they pop, leaving behind 3 coins each.

-<Pokey Flower>---------------------

A tall Cactus like plant with pink petals, they emerge from the ground
when Mario gets close and try to topple over on top of you.

If you jump on him whilst toppled or toppling over you get a coin, but
you get an extra two Gold coins for killing him whilst upright.

Best to jump on his head just after he erects himself, most people prefer
to Ground Pound him (possibly after hovering,) since it lands on a larger
area, (I.e. more likely to hit his head).
Personally I like to Body Slam its head, (assuming room to land,) since
I don't need to jump as high.

You could also use Yoshi, but it's harder to time the attack right.

-<Red Cataquack>---------------------=
See:- Cataquack.

-<Scuttle Bug>---------------------=

I haven't played Mario64 for quite a long time, so when I think of its
Scuttle Bugs I remember them being two eyed, yellow bugs with 4 legs...
Until I find a picture to say otherwise, I'm sure these are similar.

Anyway, to defeat these, you have to Pound the other side of the Metal
Screen they're walking on. (They'll fly off until they hit something.)
Or use a Yoshi to Eat/Juice them.

-<Singing Flower>---------------------

Not an Enemy, just a flower with pink petals, that makes a singing sound
when watered.
Water all the Singing Flowers together, to get the coin from each to
appear. May need to Sprinkler Squirt to do this.

-<Skeeter>---------------------=

Mario64 had water skaters that looked just like this, hence the name.

These guys feel the splashes in the water and zoom straight over. Also
instead of dying, when jumped on, they bounce you really high up in the
air. Squirting them only stuns them.
Use the above facts to help you get onto High ledges.

If you want to kill them for Coins, you have to use a Yoshi, remember
to use Lily-pads as boats.
Note: If Skeeters skim onto land, or onto a Lily-pad they die, without
leaving any coins behind either.

-<Sleeping Boo>---------------------

A Large Boo that sleeps all day long, blocking off passages.
Use a Yoshi to defeat these pests, and get a coin!

-<Yoshi Egg Koopas>---------------------

More of a Mini-Boss then a normal enemy...
Looks like a giant Yoshi egg in the sand, but wake it up and you'll see
that it's a Big Koopa in disguise!

When it gets close, it'll back-up and try Pound you into the ground, dodge
out of the way, and it'll stick in the sand. Ground Pound its Belly to
defeat it.....
...One gold coin will appear, (collect it,) then a circle of Sunflowers
will shoot out of the ground. 5 more coins appear in a circle around
this. (Watch out some coins disappear quickly.)

Each Koopa get harder, as they stay on their backs for a shorter period,
with each one defeated.

#=====================================================================
-<Mario's Moves Extra>-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just some more information about the moves you can make, beyond that given
by the game manual.
Some of this might prove useful to bear in mind when collecting coins.
=====================================================================
-<Slide/Dive & Front Somersault>---------------------
Pressing "B" to dive, then "A" to Front Somersault is the faster then
just running.
However you might find Slip-Sliding faster still over long distances. Wet
the ground and dive onto it.

If your Front Somersault lands on a steep slope, you'll run up/down/along
the slope faster ten usual. You'll see "Il Piantissmo" do this same trick
up the last tree in Pianta Village.

Diving at any point during any Jump (that you can) will send you forwards
a great distance more then only holding forward.
Ideally press A & B at the same time, to start your Spin Jump (instead
of just A). This is the furthest you can Jump without Fludd/Yoshi/etc.

-<Jumps>---------------------
Spin Jumps and Triple Jumps (the third of the 3 jumps,) are the best for
Mario to gain height or distance. Although roughly the same, I find the
Triple Jump seems to go higher of the two and Spin Jump further, (but
harder to direct straight).

You can turn a most of the normal jumps into Spin Jumps mid-jump, just
spin the Control Stick. It might take you a little further, but it's
not going to get you as far as a normal Spin Jump.
(The Triple Jump is one of the one that doesn't work, otherwise....)

-<Wall Jumps>---------------------
Remember not to stand to close to the wall, or you won't slide down it.

A Side Somersault, Wall Jump, then Hover, is a good way to get atop high
walls and buildings.

-<Triangle Jumps>---------------------
A Pianta tells you about this move early in the game, it's not in the
manual though. (Well not my PAL one anyway!)

Same as a Wall Jump, except instead of jumping at the wall at 90 degrees
and bouncing off at 90, jump at the wall at an angle to bounce off at
the opposite angle.
If you jump towards the wall at 45 degrees, you will Wall Jump off at
135 degrees.
"The Shell's Secret" has section just for these, but are useful at other
parts of the game too.

-<Ground Pound>---------------------
Mario gains a bit of height before plummeting, so can help you reach
those coins just over your head, at the peak of your jump.
(Also see Hover Nozzle)

Seems to have a larger landing area, then just your feet in a normal
jump. Making it easier to land on an enemy's head.

-<Swimming>---------------------
I normally tap A, B, A, B.... to go straight quickly while underwater.
When on the surface, you have to stop moving forwards to use A to jump.

-<Squirt Nozzle>---------------------
The further in you hold the R button the longer the Nozzle will squirt
out water. (Clicking in the R button lasts the longest time.)
When it does run out it will start to splutter, sending drops of water
in an arc in front of you. If you can slowly push the R button in at the
right pace, you can make it so it splutters for ages.

To clean large areas use the Running Squirt, but instead of running
straight, try swaying the stick to the left & right as you travel
forwards.

The Sprinkler Squirt isn't so useful to clean large areas, but notice
how you can go from the Sprinkler Squirt to the Sprinkler Jump (I.e.
the Spin Jump where you're squirting water everywhere,) by jumping.
It's fairly easy to direct the Sprinkler Spin before you jump so the
Spin Jump will go its full height in the right direction.
(Be quick to change back to Hover, if you want it though!)

-<Hover Nozzle>---------------------
No matter how hard you press the button, it will last the same amount of
time. Can also use it to squirt enemies/etc underneath you.
While Hovering you can't use Dive or Ground Pound. Since you can use the
Ground Pound to gain a little height, practice letting go of the R button
and pressing L straight after, before your Hover run out and you drop.

For a bit of fun try doing a Sprinkler Spin with this Nozzle attached
instead. The floor beneath you gets a good cleaning at least!

-<Rocket Nozzle>---------------------
Jump just before it's charged up to gain a little more height.
You can't turn very well when using this so face the right direction
first. Also can't spin jump because of this.
If using this to jump distances, remember to watch his shadow for
where you'll land!

Try this, hold forwards as it charges up and press B the second it goes
off. Mario will soar into the air in a big Belly Flop going miles!

-<Turbo Nozzle>---------------------
You refill Fludd whilst travelling across water, but across land you
run out quickly.

A glitch? If you hold down R on the Squirt Nozzle, so Mario can't walk,
then switch to the Turbo Nozzle, he still can't move but the water
will come out. Now release the R a little, (so it's down but not clicked
in,) and Mario zooms off full speed.
You can use this to Turbo Jump from small platforms, with no room to
charge the Turbo up on.

Try doing a Spin Jump whilst Turbo-ing, it's the furthest Mario can jump!

-<Hang/Shinny>---------------------
Mario can only hang on for a certain amount of time, before letting go
he'll stop and shake, this is your last warning to pull him up onto
the platform.
In other words if you find a place to climb up, do so, to make sure you
can make to the next one!

If you drop you'll slide down the wall ready to Wall Jump. I suppose
you can try jump & hover back to the ledge and cling on again!

-<Super Whirl Jump>---------------------
I don't think the different Nozzles make any difference to the jump
although Rocket & Turbo are easier to start the Whirling.

Don't forget, like in any jump pushing a direction will move you in it,
hold forwards to travel the furthest/etc.

-<Yoshi Moves>---------------------
Like Mario, Yoshi has a Spin Jump, Double & Triple Jump and can Ground
Pound.
However Yoshi's jumps all have a mini Hover up just after the (1st) peak.
Because of this hover, Yoshi Spin Jump goes much further and higher
then any of the other jumps.
(You can even jump atop houses and other tall objects easily!)

You won't lose any Health if hit whilst riding Yoshi, but you will
fly off and need to remount.
There's very few enemies that Yoshi can't eat and a few more that can't
be Squirted into a block also.
Note: You have to wait a while for the block to fade, for the coins
of the enemy to drop out.

Orange Yoshi: Papaya, Pineapple.. Blocks: Stationary.
Pink Yoshi. : Banana, Coconut.... Blocks: Move Upwards.
Purple Yoshi: Durian, Chilli..... Blocks: Moves horizontally in the...
...same direction the enemy was going(/facing).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'd like to thank the following people, without them this guide might not
be the completeness it is today!

First off, thanks to Nintendo, Shigeru Miyamoto and all, for bringing us
Super Mario Sunshine.

"AlexPenev" from GameFaqs' Message boards, for various help, moves & tips.
"Supreme2002" from GameFaqs' Message Boards, for episode high scores, and
various other help.
And probably lots of other people I can't remember the names of, on the
GameFaqs' Message Boards. (In topics long gone!)
