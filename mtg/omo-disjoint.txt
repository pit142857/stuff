It is due to timestamp and Interaction of Continuous Effect. According to rule 613.7a "A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static ability is on". This means that both continuous effect of Omo have the same timestamp, meaning that there is no rule that says in which order we should apply them (applying them in the order they are written is not a rule). If Omo would give land creature all types, consider the following situation:
I have Omo, [[Life and Limb]] and a Mountain with an everything counter. What are the types of the Mountain? Here, there is a dependency in layer 4 between Life and Limb's effect that turn all my forests into creatures and Omo's effect which turn my Mountain into a Forest. Since both effects of Omo have the same timestamp, I don't know which one to apply first.
* If I first apply the one that give all land types to lands with a counter, then my Mountain is a Forest. There is another dependency, my Mountain becomes a creature, and then Omo gives it all creature types. In this case, my Mountain is a creature land with all land types and with all creature types.
* If I first apply the one that give all creature types to creatures with a counter, nothing happens to the Mountain. Then, I must apply the other effect of Omo because of the dependency. Finally, I apply Life and Limb. In this case, my Mountain is a creature land with all land types but it is only a Saproling.
Since the interaction of continuous effects should not depend on a choice, there is an issue. The two effects of Omo should apply on disjoint sets of objects so that the result of the interaction is the same whatever is the order in which we apply Omo's effects.
