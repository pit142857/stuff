Martha, my dear,
Do you want to know a secret?
I want you...
Wait!
Don't let me down!
Not a second time.
I need you
any time at all.
From me to you,
I'm looking through you
here, there and everywhere.
Girl,
I want to hold your hand,
I wanna be your man!
I want to tell you
words of love.
I feel fine
within you. Without you
I'm down,
I'm a looser.
Please please me.
Why don't we do it in the road?
It won't be long!
Tomorrow never knows...
Oh! Darling!
Love me (do)!
Because
all you need is love!
I will
love you (to)
eight days a week!
Thank you girl.
Yes, it is
the end.
Good night!
P.S. I love you.
